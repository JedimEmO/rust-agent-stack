Do a sprint retrospective, and analyze the observations in `scraim/current-spraint.md`.
I want you to consider the notes in relation to CLAUDE.md files as well as the instructions in `.claude/commands`, and
see if there are any tweaks that can be made to those rules that would help prevent mistakes that we have observed.

I also want you to analyze the CLAUDE.md files and see if there is excessive amounts of text, or old/redundant
information in them,
and if there is, resolve those issues. We want to have a tight and neat set of instructions to work with!

When you are done, move the current-spraint.md file into `scraim/retroed/{sprint number}.md` and give yourself a pat on the back!
