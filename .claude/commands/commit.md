Please investigate the uncommitted changes, and create the appropriate git commits from them. Make commit messages
consist and descriptive.
Make sure you do not include files that should not go into the commit (when in doubt, ask the user if he wants to
include the file or not).
Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo test` and `cargo clippy`, and make sure everything passes before committing.

All commit messages must contain exactly one dad-level pun in the first line of the message.

For every commit, make sure to write a new changelog entry into CHANGELOG.md containing a description and date of the
change.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any Claude attribution, "Generated with Claude Code" messages, or Co-Authored-By lines in the commit messages. Keep commits clean and professional.
