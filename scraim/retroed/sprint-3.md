# Current Sprint Retrospective

## Bidirectional Chat Server Implementation (2025-01-13)

**What went well:**
- Successfully extracted and refactored ChatService from test code into standalone server with full bidirectional WebSocket support
- Implemented persistent state management with JSON file storage for rooms and messages, ensuring chat history survives server restarts

**What could have gone better:**
- Initial macro invocation had unsupported `openrpc` field that needed removal
- Several type naming mismatches between generated macro types and implementation code required debugging

## User Profile System Implementation (2025-01-13)

**What went well:**
- Successfully added user profile support with comprehensive cat avatar customization (10 breeds, 10 colors, 8 expressions)
- Integrated profile persistence seamlessly with existing state management system

**What could have gone better:**
- Had to work around private field access when trying to sync identity providers between registration endpoints
- Multiple iterations needed to properly handle Arc<ChatServer> in handler state tuples

## Sprint 1 Completion: Logging, Configuration, and Testing (2025-01-13)

**What went well:**
- Implemented comprehensive structured logging with tracing, providing excellent observability for production debugging
- Created flexible configuration system supporting both environment variables and TOML files, following 12-factor app principles

**What could have gone better:**
- Integration tests required careful port management to avoid conflicts during parallel test execution
- Had to refactor server internals to expose proper testing interfaces without breaking encapsulation

## Sprint 2 Day 1: Terminal Client Foundation (2025-01-13)

**What went well:**
- Successfully created modular client architecture with clean separation between UI, client communication, auth, and config modules
- Implemented complete ratatui-based terminal UI with proper layout including message area, user list, input field, and status bar

**What could have gone better:**
- Need to be careful about module visibility - had to update ui module exports to be public for proper access from main
