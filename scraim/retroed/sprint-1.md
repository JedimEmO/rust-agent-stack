# Current Sprint Reflection

## jsonrpc-macro Implementation (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Successful orchestration of complex multi-crate implementation with clear separation of concerns
- Auth traits designed properly from the start, avoiding later refactoring
- Macro generates working code that matches the desired API from the sketch perfectly
- Workspace dependency setup prevents version conflicts and maintains consistency

**What could have gone better:**
- Initial lifetime issues with AuthProvider trait required multiple iterations to resolve
- Should have identified the need for separate JSON-RPC types crate earlier in planning phase

## Documentation Creation (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Comprehensive README files created for all crates with practical examples
- Documentation includes complete curl examples for testing the API
- Clear integration examples show how the crates work together

**What could have gone better:**
- Documentation was added as an afterthought rather than during initial implementation

## Security Testing Expansion (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Identified and fixed actual security vulnerabilities in the authentication implementation
- Comprehensive security test suite covers username enumeration, timing attacks, and other vectors
- Fixed timing attack protection with proper constant-time dummy hash implementation

**What could have gone better:**
- Security considerations should have been part of the original identity provider implementation

## OAuth2 Client Implementation (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Clear architectural planning before implementation prevented scope creep and ensured security-first design
- PKCE and CSRF protection implemented correctly from the start following OAuth2 RFC specifications
- Seamless integration with existing IdentityProvider trait architecture without breaking changes
- Comprehensive test suite including security attack scenarios ensures production readiness

**What could have gone better:**
- Could have started with a simpler MVP and iterated, though the comprehensive approach worked well given clear requirements

## Google OAuth2 Full-Stack Example (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Excellent coordination between Architect, Coder, and UX Designer roles created a comprehensive showcase
- Architect's detailed planning ensured all components integrated seamlessly without rework
- Coder successfully completed oauth2 provider implementation and built production-ready backend
- UX Designer created modern, responsive frontend that effectively demonstrates the authentication stack capabilities
- Complete example demonstrates the full power of the Rust agent stack with real-world OAuth2 integration

**What could have gone better:**
- Could have planned frontend requirements earlier to ensure all necessary backend endpoints were included from start

## Google OAuth2 Field Compatibility Fix (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Quick diagnosis of Google API endpoint version differences (v1 uses `id`, v2/v3 use `sub`)
- Elegant backward-compatible solution using serde field aliases without breaking changes

**What could have gone better:**
- Could have tested with different Google OAuth endpoint versions during initial implementation

## OAuth2 Example Routing Fix (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Identified two separate routing issues: incorrect Axum nesting syntax and macro ignoring base_url parameter
- Fixed both issues systematically: first the nesting, then the deeper macro bug
- Proper testing revealed the root cause was in the macro, not just the routing configuration

**What could have gone better:**
- Should have tested the complete end-to-end flow during initial example implementation
- Could have identified the macro bug earlier by examining generated code first

## OpenRPC Types Crate Implementation (2025-01-08)

**What went well:**
- Excellent orchestration with clear delegation to Architect then Coder based on clarified requirements
- Architect thoroughly analyzed the OpenRPC specification from local file and created comprehensive implementation plan
- Coder successfully implemented complete OpenRPC 1.3.2 specification with full type safety, validation, and ergonomic builders
- Perfect integration with existing workspace patterns and dependency management
- Comprehensive testing with 142 unit tests and working doctest examples
- Systematic debugging and fixing of bon builder string literal type mismatches

**What could have gone better:**
- Could have asked for specification location earlier rather than starting with web research
- Should have tested compilation immediately after implementation rather than assuming it would work
- Initial bon builder implementation needed string type fixes (expected String, received &str)
