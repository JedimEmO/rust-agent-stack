# Current Sprint Reflection

## jsonrpc-macro Implementation (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Successful orchestration of complex multi-crate implementation with clear separation of concerns
- Auth traits designed properly from the start, avoiding later refactoring
- Macro generates working code that matches the desired API from the sketch perfectly
- Workspace dependency setup prevents version conflicts and maintains consistency

**What could have gone better:**
- Initial lifetime issues with AuthProvider trait required multiple iterations to resolve
- Should have identified the need for separate JSON-RPC types crate earlier in planning phase

## Documentation Creation (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Comprehensive README files created for all crates with practical examples
- Documentation includes complete curl examples for testing the API
- Clear integration examples show how the crates work together

**What could have gone better:**
- Documentation was added as an afterthought rather than during initial implementation

## Security Testing Expansion (2025-01-07)

**What went well:**
- Identified and fixed actual security vulnerabilities in the authentication implementation
- Comprehensive security test suite covers username enumeration, timing attacks, and other vectors
- Fixed timing attack protection with proper constant-time dummy hash implementation

**What could have gone better:**
- Security considerations should have been part of the original identity provider implementation
