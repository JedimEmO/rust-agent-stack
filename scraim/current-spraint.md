# Current Sprint Retrospective

## REST Service Example Local Auth Integration (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Excellent orchestration approach: Architect first analyzed and planned, then Coder implemented systematically
- Comprehensive phase-by-phase implementation following established architectural patterns from google-oauth-example
- Successful integration of full local authentication stack (LocalUserProvider → SessionService → JWT → REST endpoints)
- Complete feature set implemented: user registration, login/logout, role-based permissions, and protected endpoints
- Followed security-first principles with proper password hashing, session tracking, and attack prevention
- Immediate testing and validation after each phase prevented integration issues

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have created a simpler testing script to validate the authentication flow end-to-end during development
- Initial implementation was comprehensive but could have benefited from a basic MVP first for quicker validation
