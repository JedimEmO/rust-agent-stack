# Current Sprint Retrospective

## OpenRPC Generation for jsonrpc_service Macro

### What Went Well
- Quick identification and correction of design flaw (cargo feature vs macro-level config)
- Clean architectural pivot from feature flags to macro invocation syntax
- Comprehensive implementation with both default and custom path options
- Strong test coverage and backward compatibility maintained

### What Could Have Gone Better  
- Initial architecture planning should have considered per-service granularity earlier
- Could have started with macro-level design instead of feature flag approach

## OpenRPC Types Crate Implementation (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Excellent orchestration with clear delegation to Architect then Coder based on clarified requirements
- Architect thoroughly analyzed the OpenRPC specification from local file and created comprehensive implementation plan
- Coder successfully implemented complete OpenRPC 1.3.2 specification with full type safety, validation, and ergonomic builders
- Perfect integration with existing workspace patterns and dependency management
- Comprehensive testing with 142 unit tests and working doctest examples
- Systematic debugging and fixing of bon builder string literal type mismatches

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have asked for specification location earlier rather than starting with web research
- Should have tested compilation immediately after implementation rather than assuming it would work
- Initial bon builder implementation needed string type fixes (expected String, received &str)

## Kellnr Registry Setup (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Successfully configured kellnr as default registry in `.cargo/config.toml`
- All internal dependencies already had proper versioning (path + version)
- Created comprehensive release command at `.claude/commands/kellnr-release.md` with detailed A-Z instructions
- Command-based approach provides flexibility without requiring complex scripts

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have asked about authentication requirements upfront
- Future improvements: automated version synchronization, CI/CD integration, registry health checks

## REST Macro Crate Implementation (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Excellent strategic orchestration: asked clarifying questions before delegation to understand requirements fully
- Architect provided thorough analysis of existing jsonrpc-macro patterns and created comprehensive implementation plan
- Coder successfully implemented complete REST macro with type-safe endpoints, authentication integration, and OpenAPI generation
- Perfect architectural consistency with existing JSON-RPC patterns while adapting appropriately for REST semantics
- Comprehensive feature set: all HTTP methods, path parameters, permission-based auth, OpenAPI 3.0 generation using schemars

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Implementation was complex enough that it could have been broken into smaller phases for incremental testing
- Could have created a simpler initial example to validate the core patterns before building full feature set
- Should have tested compilation and runs immediately after implementation rather than assuming it would work

### Follow-up Fix
- Successfully debugged and fixed all compilation errors: type annotations, move semantics, IntoResponse imports
- All tests now pass and crate builds successfully with full workspace integration
