# Current Sprint Retrospective

## REST Service Example Local Auth Integration (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Excellent orchestration approach: Architect first analyzed and planned, then Coder implemented systematically
- Comprehensive phase-by-phase implementation following established architectural patterns from google-oauth-example
- Successful integration of full local authentication stack (LocalUserProvider → SessionService → JWT → REST endpoints)
- Complete feature set implemented: user registration, login/logout, role-based permissions, and protected endpoints
- Followed security-first principles with proper password hashing, session tracking, and attack prevention
- Immediate testing and validation after each phase prevented integration issues

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have created a simpler testing script to validate the authentication flow end-to-end during development
- Initial implementation was comprehensive but could have benefited from a basic MVP first for quicker validation

## Static API Documentation Hosting & Explorer UI (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Strategic orchestration with clear role delegation: Architect → Backend Coder → UX Designer worked perfectly
- Architect's comprehensive plan provided excellent foundation with detailed technical specifications
- Backend implementation seamlessly integrated with existing rust-rest-macro patterns without breaking changes
- Custom API explorer UI replaced generic Swagger UI with tailored JWT authentication and responsive design
- Zero-overhead implementation when disabled - optional feature doesn't impact performance when unused

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have implemented a smaller proof-of-concept first before building the full-featured API explorer interface

## REST API Schema Documentation Fix (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Quickly identified root cause: `schemars` generated valid but UI-unfriendly `"type": ["string", "null"]` schemas
- Implemented dual-layer fix: both OpenAPI generation improvement AND JavaScript UI enhancement
- Schema normalization approach was backward compatible - existing schemas continue to work  
- End-to-end testing confirmed fix resolves the issue completely
- Changes were targeted and minimal, reducing risk of regressions

### What Could Have Gone Better  
- Could have added unit tests for the nullable type handling to prevent future regressions
- Schema normalization could be made configurable per service for flexibility

## RPC/REST Macro Crate Refactoring (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Architect role effectively analyzed the coupling problem and created comprehensive refactoring plan
- Strategic delegation approach with clear technical specifications prevented implementation errors
- Systematic execution by Coder following the detailed plan ensured smooth refactoring without compilation issues
- Created clean separation with shared `rust-auth-core` crate eliminates unwanted dependencies between REST and JSON-RPC functionality
- Maintained backward compatibility through re-exports, preserving existing API surface

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have identified this architectural coupling issue earlier during initial macro development
- Integration testing across all affected crates could have been more comprehensive

## Local Auth Investigation (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- User performed manual testing and confirmed authentication system works correctly
- No actual bug in local auth implementation - system functioning as designed

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have started with manual testing first before assuming there was a bug
- Initial problem report could have included more detailed testing steps to rule out user error

## Comprehensive Integration Testing Implementation (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Architect role provided excellent analysis of existing test gaps and identified comprehensive testing requirements
- Strategic implementation approach: added workspace dependencies first, then JSON-RPC tests, then REST tests
- Real HTTP integration testing with random port binding provides authentic validation of macro-generated services
- Comprehensive auth testing covers all permission patterns and security attack vectors (timing attacks, token validation)
- Test infrastructure discovered actual implementation issues in generated code, validating the testing approach
- Both positive and negative test scenarios included for robust validation

### What Could Have Gone Better  
- Could have implemented simpler smoke tests first before building comprehensive test suites
- Some test failures indicate underlying implementation issues in macro-generated code that need investigation

## JSON-RPC Macro Test Failure Fix (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Delegation approach worked perfectly: Coder quickly identified the root cause in parameter parsing logic
- Systematic debugging approach: ran tests → examined failures → investigated macro implementation → applied targeted fix
- Issue was in macro-generated code handling of unit type `()` parameters - rejecting valid requests with missing/null params
- Fix was minimal and backward compatible: enhanced parameter parsing to deserialize `None` as `serde_json::Value::Null` for unit types
- All 4 failing tests now pass: `test_unauthorized_methods`, `test_authentication_required_methods`, `test_admin_permission_methods`, `test_concurrent_requests`

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have caught this during initial macro development with more comprehensive edge case testing for different parameter types
