# Current Sprint Retrospective

## OpenRPC Generation for jsonrpc_service Macro

### What Went Well
- Quick identification and correction of design flaw (cargo feature vs macro-level config)
- Clean architectural pivot from feature flags to macro invocation syntax
- Comprehensive implementation with both default and custom path options
- Strong test coverage and backward compatibility maintained

### What Could Have Gone Better  
- Initial architecture planning should have considered per-service granularity earlier
- Could have started with macro-level design instead of feature flag approach
