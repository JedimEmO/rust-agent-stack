# Current Sprint Retrospective

## REST Service Example Local Auth Integration (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Excellent orchestration approach: Architect first analyzed and planned, then Coder implemented systematically
- Comprehensive phase-by-phase implementation following established architectural patterns from google-oauth-example
- Successful integration of full local authentication stack (LocalUserProvider → SessionService → JWT → REST endpoints)
- Complete feature set implemented: user registration, login/logout, role-based permissions, and protected endpoints
- Followed security-first principles with proper password hashing, session tracking, and attack prevention
- Immediate testing and validation after each phase prevented integration issues

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have created a simpler testing script to validate the authentication flow end-to-end during development
- Initial implementation was comprehensive but could have benefited from a basic MVP first for quicker validation

## Static API Documentation Hosting & Explorer UI (2025-01-08)

### What Went Well
- Strategic orchestration with clear role delegation: Architect → Backend Coder → UX Designer worked perfectly
- Architect's comprehensive plan provided excellent foundation with detailed technical specifications
- Backend implementation seamlessly integrated with existing rust-rest-macro patterns without breaking changes
- Custom API explorer UI replaced generic Swagger UI with tailored JWT authentication and responsive design
- Zero-overhead implementation when disabled - optional feature doesn't impact performance when unused

### What Could Have Gone Better
- Could have implemented a smaller proof-of-concept first before building the full-featured API explorer interface
