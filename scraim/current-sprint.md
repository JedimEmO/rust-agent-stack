# Current Sprint Retrospective

## Bidirectional Chat Server Implementation (2025-01-13)

**What went well:**
- Successfully extracted and refactored ChatService from test code into standalone server with full bidirectional WebSocket support
- Implemented persistent state management with JSON file storage for rooms and messages, ensuring chat history survives server restarts

**What could have gone better:**
- Initial macro invocation had unsupported `openrpc` field that needed removal
- Several type naming mismatches between generated macro types and implementation code required debugging

## User Profile System Implementation (2025-01-13)

**What went well:**
- Successfully added user profile support with comprehensive cat avatar customization (10 breeds, 10 colors, 8 expressions)
- Integrated profile persistence seamlessly with existing state management system

**What could have gone better:**
- Had to work around private field access when trying to sync identity providers between registration endpoints
- Multiple iterations needed to properly handle Arc<ChatServer> in handler state tuples
